## Code Conventions

### Workflow (IMPORTANT)
For every change:
1. Run `npm run lint` and fix any errors/warnings
2. Run `npm run test` and ensure all tests pass
3. Commit the changes

### Testing
- Test framework: Vitest
- Run tests: `npm run test`
- Run lint: `npm run lint`
- Good CI tests: Pure utility functions, i18n, validation, constants mapping
- Avoid: Tests requiring database, network, or complex mocking

### Styling
- Tailwind CSS 4 with custom variant for dark mode
- Dark mode: Uses `.dark` class on `<html>` element
- Color scheme: Indigo for events, Teal for places
- CSS variables: `--background`, `--foreground`

### Component Patterns
- Client components use `'use client'` directive
- Server components for data fetching pages
- Form components use controlled state pattern
- Map components use React Leaflet

## Theme System

The app uses a `ThemeProvider` context with:
- `theme`: 'light' | 'dark'
- `toggleTheme()`: Toggle between themes
- `setTheme(theme)`: Set specific theme

Dark mode is applied via:
1. CSS class `.dark` on `<html>` element
2. Tailwind's `dark:` variant for dark mode styles
3. `@custom-variant dark (&:where(.dark, .dark *))` in globals.css

## API Structure

All API routes are under `/api/`:
- `/api/cities` - City management
- `/api/events` - Event CRUD
- `/api/places` - Place CRUD
- `/api/auth` - Authentication
- `/api/user` - User profile and settings
- `/api/search` - Global search

## Key Components

### Cards
- `EventCard` - Event display with image, category, price, countdown
- `PlaceCard` - Place display with image, rating, price range

### Forms
- `FormInput`, `FormSelect`, `CategorySelector`, `FormButton`
- Multi-step forms: `StepBasicInfo`, `StepDateTime`, `StepLocation`

### Maps
- `EventMap` - Leaflet map with event markers
- `PlaceMap` - Leaflet map with place markers

## Improvements Needed

### Text Overflow Issues
- Category buttons in `CategorySelector` may overflow on smaller screens
- Long titles in cards may need better truncation
- Place/event detail pages need max-width constraints on text content

### Dark Mode Improvements
- `PlaceCard.tsx` - Needs dark mode styles
- `PlaceCardBadges.tsx` - Rating and badges need dark mode
- `Footer.tsx` - Missing dark mode background
- `SearchBar.tsx` - Dropdown results need dark mode
- `ToggleOption` in forms - Missing dark mode
- Dashboard cards - Missing dark mode
- Event/Place detail pages - Missing dark mode backgrounds
- Note info boxes - Missing dark mode
